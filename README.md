## Designated Area (DA) 

refers to a geographical area defined by the area of responsibility of a Designated Official. Usually a DA is equivalent to a specific country, except in countries with more than one Designated Official. These would include such countries as Sudan (Darfur and Sudan), Lebanon (North and South Lebanon), Syria (Syria and the Golan Heights) and Serbia (Serbia and Kosovo) where the country is divided into two designated areas.

## Security Area (SA) 

referes to a geographical area usually defined by the area of responsibility of an Area Security Coordinators (ASC). Usually the Security Area (SA) consists of one or several Security Level Areas (SLA). The number of Security Areas (SA) in a DA is determined by the Country Security Management Team (SMT).

# Security Level Area (SLA) 

refers to a clearly defined geographical area within a Security Area (SA) that is determined by the Designated Official (DO) through the CSA/SA with the approval of the SMT (SPM IV, B, 7).  Each distinct security environment is defined by a Security Level Area (SLA), which has similar threats and hazards throughout the area determined by the Structured Threat Assessment (STA). The SLA must be contiguous, which means if you were drawing the border with a pen, you should not be lifting it until you complete the SLA. A donut shape is okay, where the hole is considered another SLA.
